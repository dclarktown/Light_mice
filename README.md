Figure 2: female activity data 
- The "ActogramJ_data" file contains the PIR data and the "wheel_CD" file contains the wheel running data that were read into ActogramJ to create the actograms. 
- The same PIR data that was used for the actograms was used for the nparACT analysis and activity count data by light cycle and is available in the "counting_activity_light_dark_cycles" file. 

# Code

The statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism and R. R code is provided to recapitulate the statistical results from Prism.
